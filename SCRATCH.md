# Scratch / working state

Living record of what is being built, what has been found, what worked and what
did not. Read this first when resuming work with no other context.

## Goal

Produce 2D orthographic / blueprint style **mechanical diagrams** (the kind you
would use to design a laser-cut or milled mounting plate, as in the Onshape
document the request linked) for:

1. Every Tiny Tapeout demo board -- outline, mounting holes, the Pmod headers
   along the "front" edge (3 on later boards, 2 on early ones), USB-C
   power/control connector, 7-segment display, other LEDs.
2. Raspberry Pi 3, 4 and 5 -- outline, mounting holes, power-input USB
   connector, USB-A ports, Ethernet jack, and where the Pmod headers land when
   a Digilent Pmod HAT Adapter is fitted.
3. Generic AliExpress PoE -> micro-USB splitter, and the Waveshare 25 W PoE ->
   USB-C splitter.
4. A "Tiny Tapeout generic mounting plate": one plate, pre-drilled so that any
   Tiny Tapeout demo board version can be mounted on standoffs with the Pmod
   headers always ending up in the same place.

## Ground rules (from the request)

- Data first: put everything into a computer-readable file (Python dicts).
- Use **official** sources: Tiny Tapeout KiCad files, Raspberry Pi Ltd
  mechanical drawings, Digilent Pmod spec, vendor product pages.
- Quick/hacky extraction scripts are fine. Do **not** build big test suites.
- Commit after every change, small logical commits. The git history is the log.
- Periodically have sub-agents review (a) the code and (b) the diagrams.

## Status

Phase: **data collected, drawing engine next**.

### Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi Ltd publish per-model mechanical drawings. `datasheets.raspberrypi.com`
now 301-redirects to `pip.raspberrypi.com`, so `curl -L` is required.

- Pi 3B, Pi 3B+, Pi 4B: **DXF available** -- layered
  (`BOARD_OUTLINE`, `PARTS_TOP`, `PINS_TOP`, `SILK_TOP`, ...). This is by far
  the best source: exact geometry plus silkscreen reference designators.
- Pi 3A+, Pi 5: PDF only. The Pi 5 drawing is 1:1 vector on A4, so the geometry
  can be lifted out of the PDF content stream.

### Digilent Pmod

- Pmod Interface Specification 1.2.0 gives the numbers that matter: 2.54 mm
  (.10 in) pin grid in both axes, and **22.86 mm (.90 in) centre-to-centre
  spacing between adjacent host ports on a board edge**.  Host keep-out box is
  10.16 mm (.40 in) across with a 3.81 mm (.15 in) margin from the pin
  envelope.  The spec gives no numeric host-side board-edge setback.
- **Digilent publish nothing mechanical for the Pmod HAT Adapter (410-366).**
  No drawing, no DXF, no STEP, no board files anywhere under
  github.com/Digilent.  Reference manual and schematic are electrical only.
  So `scripts/measure_pmod_hat.py` measures the three host positions off
  Digilent's official top-view photo, using the four HAT mounting screws to set
  scale and origin.  Cross-check against the pin pitch says the result is good
  to about +/-0.75 mm.  JA and JB measured 23.18 mm apart and are snapped to
  the specified 22.86 mm.
- Digilent's site is behind Cloudflare.  `curl` gets a 403 unless it sends a
  browser User-Agent plus a matching `Referer` and `Sec-Fetch-*` headers.

### PoE splitters

- Waveshare PoE Splitter (25 W) Type-C: **102.5 x 29.6 x 24.8 mm**, from both
  the product page specification table and Waveshare's own dimensioned image.
  Finned aluminium extrusion, RJ45 in one end plate, captive lead at the other
  ending in an RJ45 male plug and a USB-C male plug.  5 V 5 A out, 37-57 V in.
  No panel mounting holes.
- Generic AliExpress PoE -> micro-USB: no single authority.  Most AliExpress
  listings quote the packaging, not the body.  Two independent sources agree on
  an 80 mm body: DSLRKIT's own 80 x 27 x 22 mm and Adafruit's measured
  80 x 30 x 24 mm.  Gigabit variants run longer, around 95 mm.  Glued plastic
  clamshell, no mounting holes.

### Tiny Tapeout shuttles after TT08

Per tinytapeout.com/chips, **no shuttle after TT08 has shipped**.  TT09 shows
TBD/TBD, TT10 was cancelled, and every IHP/SKY/GF run since carries only an
estimated delivery date.  So there is no authoritative TT09+ board revision to
find, and the v3.x boards are recorded without a shuttle.

## Decisions

- Extract geometry from machine-readable sources (KiCad `.kicad_pcb` s-expr,
  DXF, 1:1 vector PDF) rather than transcribing dimension text by eye.
- Hand-curated numbers are always tagged with their source in the data file.
- Machine-read the *numbers*, hand-curate the *identification*.  Each extractor
  carries a small table saying which designator, or which approximate position
  and size, corresponds to which mechanical role.  A source that changes makes
  the selector miss and the script fail loudly.
- Coordinate frame for everything: origin at the lower-left corner of the
  board's bounding box, X right, Y up, top view, millimetres.

## Key facts for the mounting plate

- **Pmod host pitch is 22.86 mm on every Tiny Tapeout revision**, TT01 through
  v3.3, because the Digilent spec mandates it.  That is what makes a single
  generic plate possible.
- The distance from the front board edge to the Pmod pin-field centre does
  change between generations:

  | Board | Pin-field centre Y | Pmod centre X positions |
  |-------|-------------------|--------------------------|
  | mpw-mb1 2.2.6 (TT01-03) | 4.465 | 41.85, 64.71 (two only) |
  | v1.2.2 / v1.2.3 (TT04/05) | 4.275 | 27.695, 50.555, 73.415 |
  | v2.0.1 / v2.1.0 / v2.1.2 (TT06-08) | 3.775 | 28.005, 50.865, 73.725 |
  | v3.2 / v3.3 | 3.23 | 19.35, 42.21, 65.07 |

- Mounting hole patterns differ per generation, and v3 has only two holes,
  on a diagonal:

  | Board | Size | Holes (dia 3.2 mm) |
  |-------|------|--------------------|
  | mpw-mb1 2.2.6, v1.2.x | 104.5 x 81.0 | 3.75/3.75, 100.75/3.75, 3.75/77.25, 100.75/77.25 |
  | v2.x | 99.5 x 78.0 | 3.5/3.5, 96.0/8.0, 3.5/74.5, 96.0/74.5 |
  | v3.2 | 85.0 x 80.0 | 4.0/76.0, 77.0/8.5 |
  | v3.3 | 85.0 x 85.0 | 4.0/81.0, 77.0/8.5 |

  Note the v2.x lower-right hole is at Y = 8.0, not 3.5: that pattern is not
  symmetric.

## Things that did not work

- `curl` without `-L` against `datasheets.raspberrypi.com` returns a 301 with a
  zero-length body. Always follow redirects.
- Cloning `tt-demo-pcb` with `--filter=blob:none` makes walking history
  painfully slow (each `git show` is a network round trip). Re-fetched all
  blobs with `git fetch --refetch`.
- **The KiCad footprint rotation transform was wrong at first** and silently
  mirrored every rotated footprint about its own origin.  KiCad measures
  rotation counter-clockwise on a Y-down screen, so the transform is the
  transpose of the usual maths-frame one.  Parts at 0 and 180 degrees come out
  identical either way, which is why it survived a first look.  Caught by
  plotting the extraction over the official board render: the 2x16 ANALOG
  header came out hanging off the left edge of the board.
- Connector footprints can carry their own `Edge.Cuts` geometry.  Reading only
  board-level edge cuts lost the USB-C recess in the TT04/TT05 board's upper
  edge.
- `pdfplumber` reports path points as `(x, top)`, Y down from the top of the
  sheet.  Using them directly mirrors the whole board vertically, and the
  mounting hole pattern is symmetric enough to hide it.  Caught because the
  40-pin GPIO header came out along the bottom edge instead of the top.
- Fetching Digilent images with plain `curl` returns a Cloudflare challenge
  page with a `.png` name.  A browser User-Agent plus `Referer` and
  `Sec-Fetch-*` headers gets the real file.
- Trying to pull the Digilent image out of a Playwright page with `fetch()` or
  a canvas both failed, on CSP and then on a hang.  Plain `curl` with the right
  headers was the answer.
